** Introduction

   vdiff compares two or three buffers on the basis of the output from the diff
   tool. The buffers are kept synchronized so that as you move through one of
   the buffers the top of the active buffer aligns with the corresponding top of
   the other buffer(s). This is similar to how ediff works, but in ediff you use
   a third "control buffer" to move through the diffed buffers. The key
   difference is that in vdiff you are meant to actively edit one of the buffers
   and the display will update automatically for the other buffer. Similar to
   ediff, vdiff provides commands to "send" and "receive" hunks from one buffer
   to the other as well as commands to traverse the diff hunks, which are useful
   if you are trying to merge changes. In contrast to ediff, vdiff also provides
   folding capabilities to fold sections of the buffers that don't contain
   changes. This folding occurs automatically. Finally, you are encouraged to
   bind a key to `vdiff-hydra/body', which will use hydra.el (in ELPA) to create
   a convenient transient keymap containing most of the useful vdiff commands.

   This functionality is all inspired by (but not equivalent to) the vimdiff
   tool from vim.

   Contributions and suggestions are very welcome.

** Recent (Significant) Changes
   - [2018-04-17] Add option to use various git diff algorithms. See
     =vdiff-diff-algorithm= for options.
   - [2017-05-17] Split =vdiff-magit.el= into [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-vdiff-magit][separate repository]]. 
   - [2017-02-01] Added magit integration functions in =vdiff-magit.el=.
   - [2016-07-25] Added three-way diff support. See =vdiff-buffers3= and =vdiff-files3=.

** Installation and Usage
   
vdiff is available in MELPA, which is the recommended way to install it and keep
it up to date. To install it you may do =M-x package-install RET vdiff RET=.

To start a vdiff session, the main entry points are

| Command                | Description                                                       |
|------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =vdiff-buffers=        | Diff two open buffers                                             |
| =vdiff-files=          | Diff two files                                                    |
| =vdiff-buffers3=       | Diff three open buffers                                           |
| =vdiff-files3=         | Diff three files                                                  |
| =vdiff-current-file=   | Like =ediff-current-file= (Diff buffer with disk version of file) |
| =vdiff-merge-conflict= | Use vdiff to resolve merge conflicts in current file              |
   
After installing you can bind the commands to your preferred key prefix like this

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'vdiff)
(define-key vdiff-mode-map (kbd "C-c") vdiff-mode-prefix-map)
#+END_SRC

which will bind most of the commands under the =C-c= prefix when vdiff-mode is
active. Of course you can pick whatever prefix you prefer. With the =C-c= prefix
the commands would be

*** Basics
    
| Key     | Command                 | Description                        |

Evil-mode users might prefer something like the following to use a comma as a
prefix in normal state.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'vdiff)
(require 'evil)
(evil-define-key 'normal vdiff-mode-map "," vdiff-mode-prefix-map)
#+END_SRC

vimdiff-like binding are provided by [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]]'s [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection/blob/master/evil-collection-vdiff.el][evil-collection-vdiff.el]]

** Hydra

Using the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra package]], =vdiff-hydra= allows quick movement and changes to be
made in the buffer. By default it lives on the =h= command in the prefix
map. Bind =vdiff-hydra/body= directly to customize this key binding.

  ;; diff3 command to use. Specify as a list where the car is the command to use
  ;; and the remaining elements are the arguments to the command.
  (setq vdiff-diff3-command '("diff3"))

  ;; Don't use folding in vdiff buffers if non-nil.
  (setq vdiff-disable-folding nil)

  ;; Unchanged lines to leave unfolded around a fold
  (setq vdiff-fold-padding 6)

  ;; If non-nil, allow closing new folds around point after updates.
  (setq vdiff-may-close-fold-on-point t)

  ;; Function that returns the string printed for a closed fold. The arguments
  ;; passed are the number of lines folded, the text on the first line, and the
  ;; width of the buffer.
  (setq vdiff-fold-string-function 'vdiff-fold-string-default)

  ;; Default syntax table class code to use for identifying "words" in
  ;; `vdiff-refine-this-change'. Some useful options are

  ;; 
  ;; For more information see
  ;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Syntax-Class-Table.html
  (setq vdiff-default-refinement-syntax-code "w")

  ;; If non-nil, automatically refine all hunks.
  (setq vdiff-auto-refine nil)

  ;; How to represent subtractions (i.e., deleted lines). The
  ;; default is full which means add the same number of (fake) lines
  ;; as those that were removed. The choice single means add only one
  ;; fake line. The choice fringe means don't add lines but do
  ;; indicate the subtraction location in the fringe.
  (setq vdiff-subtraction-style 'full)

  ;; Character to use for filling subtraction lines. See also
  ;; `vdiff-subtraction-style'.
