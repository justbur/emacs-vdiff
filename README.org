* vdiff

A tool like vimdiff for Emacs 

** Introduction

vdiff is a diff tool for Emacs that is made to behave like vimdiff, meaning diff
information is displayed in buffers as you edit them. There are commands for
cycling through the hunks detected by =diff= and applying changes from one
buffer to the other. The main features are

  1. Synchronized scrolling of the buffers with lines matching between the two
  2. Commands to transmit (send/receive) hunks between buffers
  3. Automatic folding of lines that are unchanged in both buffers
  4. Commands to jump easily between hunks
  5. Everything done through overlays, meaning vdiff doesn't alter the actual
     text in the buffer (unless you are transmit changes of course)

vdiff is still a work in progress, so use it at your own risk. Contributions and
suggestions are very welcome.

** Installation and Usage
   
vdiff was recently added to MELPA, which is the recommended way to install it
and keep it up to date. To install it you may do =M-x package-install RET vdiff
RET=.
   
After installing you can bind the commands to your preferred key prefix like this

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'vdiff)
(define-key vdiff-mode-map (kbd "C-c") vdiff-mode-prefix-map)
#+END_SRC

which will bind most of the commands under the =C-c= prefix when vdiff-mode is
active. Of course you can pick whatever prefix you prefer. With the =C-c= prefix
the commands would be

| Key     | Command                   | Description                                        |
|---------+---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| =C-c g= | =vdiff-switch-buffer=     | Jump to the corresponding line in the other buffer |
| =C-c n= | =vdiff-next-hunk=         | Move to next hunk in buffer                        |
| =C-c p= | =vdiff-previous-hunk=     | Move to previous hunk in buffer                    |
| =C-c N= | =vdiff-next-fold=         | Move to next fold in buffer                        |
| =C-c P= | =vdiff-previous-fold=     | Move to previous fold in buffer                    |
| =C-c r= | =vdiff-receive-changes=   | Receive the corresponding hunk from other buffer   |
| =C-c s= | =vdiff-send-changes=      | Send this hunk (or all in region) to other buffer  |
| =C-c f= | =vdiff-refine-this-hunk=  | Highlight changed words in hunk                    |
| =C-c F= | =vdiff-refine-all-hunks=  | Highlight changed words in hunk                    |
| =C-c c= | =vdiff-close-fold=        | Close fold at point or in region                   |
| =C-c C= | =vdiff-close-all-folds=   | Close all folds in buffer                          |
| =C-c t= | =vdiff-close-other-folds= | Close all other folds in buffer                    |
| =C-c o= | =vdiff-open-fold=         | Open fold at point or in region                    |
| =C-c O= | =vdiff-open-all-folds=    | Open all folds in buffer                           |
| =C-c w= | =vdiff-save-buffers=      | Save both buffers                                  |
| =C-c q= | =vdiff-quit=              | Quit vdiff                                         |
| =C-l=   | =vdiff-sync-and-center=   | Recenter both buffers at current line              |
| =C-c h= | =vdiff-maybe-hydra=       | Enter vdiff-hydra if defined (see below)           |

Evil-mode users might prefer something like the following to use =,= as a prefix
in normal state.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'vdiff)
(require 'evil)
(evil-define-key 'normal vdiff-mode-map "," vdiff-mode-prefix-map)
#+END_SRC

To start vdiff, use either =vdiff-files= to select two files or =vdiff-buffers=
to select two open buffers.

** Hydra (optional)

If the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra package]] is loaded, =vdiff-hydra= is defined to allow quick movement
and changes to be made in the buffer. By default it lives on the =h= command in
the prefix map. Bind =vdiff-maybe-hydra= directly to customize this.

** Further customization
   
The current customization options and there defaults are
   
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Whether to lock scrolling by default when starting vdiff
  (setq vdiff-lock-scrolling t)

  ;; external diff program/command to use
  (setq vdiff-diff-program "diff")

  ;; Extra arguments to pass to diff. If this is set wrong, you may
  ;; break vdiff.
  (setq vdiff-diff-program-args "")

  ;; Unchanged lines to leave unfolded around a fold
  (setq vdiff-fold-padding 6)

  ;; Minimum number of lines to fold
  (setq vdiff-min-fold-size 4)

  ;; Function that returns the string printed for a closed fold. The arguments
  ;; passed are the number of lines folded, the text on the first line, and the
  ;; width of the buffer.
  (setq vdiff-fold-string-function 'vdiff-fold-string-default)

  ;; Default syntax table class code to use for identifying \"words\" in
  ;; \`vdiff-refine-this-change'. Some useful options are
  ;; 
  ;; \"w\"   (default) words
  ;; \"w_\"  symbols \(really words plus symbol constituents\)
  ;; 
  ;; For more information see
  ;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Syntax-Class-Table.html
  (setq vdiff-default-refinement-syntax-code "w")
#+END_SRC
